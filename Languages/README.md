# Guidelines for Frequently Used Languages


---

These are the guidelines specific to the languages we use most frequently. If
you find yourself coding frequently in a language not listed or with 
insufficient guidelines, please write up a proposal following industry standard
best practices (and some personal preferences if the practices are ambiguous) 
and submit a pull request.
