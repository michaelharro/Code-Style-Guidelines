# Guidelines for Frequently Used Languages


---

These are the guidelines specific to the languages we use most frequently. 

If you find yourself coding frequently in a language not listed or one with 
insufficient guidelines, please write up a proposal following industry standard
best practices (include personal preferences only if the practices are 
ambiguous or still being developed) and submit a pull request.
