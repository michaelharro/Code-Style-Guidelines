# General HTML Guidelines

---

This section contains the guidelines for our HTML and variant languages
such as HAML and Jade. 

This guide is less about the way we write our HTML or the elements we use
and more about our file organization, required lines of code, and placement of
resources such as CSS and JS for maximum performance.

the pieces will be given as well which will help greatly with site
