# Project Organization and File Structure 

---

Now that we will be working on large, long running projects with multiple developers, 
it is essential that we organize our project in the same way in order to: 

* Facilitate efficient collaboration between developers
* Include new team members quickly
* 

## Table of Contents

* [CSS document anatomy](#css-document-anatomy)
	* [General](#general)
	* [Single file vs many files](#single-file-vs-many-files)
	* [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
	* [Section Titles](#section-titles)
* [Order and Organization](#order-and-organization)

## CSS Document Anatomy

No matter the document, we must always try and keep a common formatting. This
means consistent commenting, consistent syntax and consistent naming.

### General

Limit your stylesheets to a maximum 80 character width where possible.
Exceptions may be gradient syntax and URLs in comments. Thereâ€™s
nothing we can do about those.

I prefer single-tab indents set to four space size and write multi-line CSS.
